### dendrite_sim

Minimal code to simulate dendritic networks.  

`dla_simple.py` uses pure Margolus shuffling, resulting in roughly isotropic cluster growth

`dla_ac.py` takes Margolus shuffling as a basis and introduces probabilistic growth and an oscillating, Gaussian bias.
the cluster is represented as a graph and degree centrality calculated
